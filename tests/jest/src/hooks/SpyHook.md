Spying on a mock isn't generally considered best practice because mocks are already controlled and tracked by Jest
itself, meaning they already provide methods like `.mock.calls` to inspect how many times a function was called and what
arguments it received. When you spy on a mock, you're introducing an additional layer of complexity that might not be
necessary, especially since mocks are meant to replace real implementations.

### Considerations:

1. **Mocks vs. Spies:**

    - **Mocks** are used to replace actual implementations with a controlled version of the function that you can
      manipulate and assert on.
    - **Spies** are used to track and observe calls to existing functions (whether real or mocked), often with the goal
      of inspecting how they behave without changing their behavior.

2. **Redundancy:**
   When you spy on a mock, you're essentially tracking a function that's already being tracked by Jest. You might end up
   doing unnecessary work or duplicating functionality (i.e., tracking function calls in two places).

3. **Complexity:**
   Spying on a mock increases the complexity of your tests. Jest already provides features like `toHaveBeenCalled` and
   `toHaveBeenCalledWith` to inspect how mocks were called, so adding a spy on top of that might make your tests harder
   to maintain.

4. **Why Spy on a Mock?**
   Spying on mocks might be useful in some specific scenarios, for example:

    - If you need to track more detailed behavior (like whether a certain consumer was notified) without altering the
      mock itself.
    - If you're trying to confirm that a mock itself was set up or called in certain situations, and you need more
      control or visibility than what the default Jest mock tracking provides.

    However, these cases are relatively rare and should be considered exceptional.

### Best Practices

1. **Use Mocks for Controlled Behavior:**
   If you're replacing a real implementation with a mock, use Jest's built-in mock functionality to observe and control
   its behavior. There's typically no need to spy on it unless you have a very specific use case.

    For example:

    ```javascript
    const myMock = jest.fn().mockReturnValue(42);
    expect(myMock()).toBe(42); // Checks the return value
    expect(myMock).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1); // Checks the number of calls
    ```

2. **Use Spies for Existing Functions:**
   If you're testing real implementations or methods that aren't mocked, you can use spies (via `jest.spyOn`) to track
   how those functions are used.

    For example:

    ```javascript
    const service = new SomeService();
    const spy = jest.spyOn(service, "someMethod");

    service.someMethod();

    expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();
    ```

3. **Combine Mocks and Spies Wisely:**
   If you must combine mocks and spies, ensure you're clear about the distinction between the two. Don't spy on mocks
   unless you need to observe them at a level beyond what Jest's `mock.calls` already provides.

4. **Consider the Test's Purpose:**
   Your decision to use a spy or mock should be driven by the goal of the test. If you need to replace behavior and
   control outputs, mocks are ideal. If you need to observe behavior or interactions with an existing implementation,
   spies are better suited.

### Conclusion:

It is not a common practice to spy on mocks because it often leads to redundancy and increased complexity. Jest provides
plenty of built-in functionality to inspect mock behavior without needing additional spying. However, in specific use
cases where you need more visibility or tracking of how mocks are interacting with other components, spying on a mock
might be warrantedâ€”but it should be done sparingly and with caution.
